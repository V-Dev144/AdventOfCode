# AdventOfCode -2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you donâ€™t know about AdventOfCode.com (short AoC) yet, please head over to the website and check it out. It is basically an advent calendar for geeks which reveals an algorithmic challenge for each day.

They are embedded in a nice story that will span 25 days.
